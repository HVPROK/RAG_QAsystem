Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Q&A System
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Streamlit for the interface and the Gemini API for the Large Language Model (LLM). It is designed to answer user queries based on a fixed knowledge base, providing a confidence score for each response.

Setup
Install dependencies via pip install -r requirements.txt. Run the app with streamlit run rag_app.py.

Design Overview
This RAG system uses 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' for embeddings and FAISS for vector search (Cosine Similarity).
The core logic separates document retrieval from answer generation, powered by the Gemini API.

Confidence Score
Confidence is the mean of the top $k$ cosine similarity scores from the retrieved knowledge chunks.

Future Improvement Note
If given more time, the system would be primarily improved by focusing on system design for 
production-readiness and scalability:

The immediate goal would be to implement an asynchronous ingestion and queuing system. This involves:

Adding a dedicated file attachment area in the Streamlit interface.

Triggering an asynchronous (background) process for PDF text extraction and embedding generation (vectorization).

Utilizing a message queue (like Redis or RabbitMQ) to manage document ingestion and retrieval requests. This ensures that multiple users can interact harmoniously and prevents one long ingestion process from blocking the entire application, leading to a much more responsive API. This architecture is necessary for handling concurrent users and large document uploads.

# 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Q&A System

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using **Streamlit** for the user interface and the **Gemini API** as the Large Language Model (LLM).  
It is designed to answer user queries based on a fixed knowledge base, providing **accurate responses** with an associated **confidence score**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Streamlit Interface** for real-time Q&A.  
- **RAG Pipeline** that retrieves context before generating an answer.  
- **Embeddings with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`** for semantic search.  
- **FAISS Vector Store** for efficient similarity-based document retrieval.  
- **Confidence Scoring System** to indicate response reliability.

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the Streamlit App
bash
Copy code
streamlit run rag_app.py

---

## 🧩 Design Overview
The RAG system follows a modular architecture with clear separation between document retrieval and answer generation.

🔹 Embedding Model
Uses all-MiniLM-L6-v2 to convert documents and queries into vector embeddings.

🔹 Vector Store
Employs FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for fast and scalable cosine similarity-based search.

🔹 LLM Integration
The Gemini API is used for generating final answers after retrieving the most relevant context.

---

## 📊 Confidence Score Calculation

The confidence score represents how relevant the retrieved context is to the user query.

Confidence=Mean of Top-k Cosine Similarity Scores

This score provides a transparent measure of how much the model “trusts” its retrieved data.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
If given additional time, the system can be enhanced for production readiness and scalability with the following improvements:

🧵 1. Asynchronous Ingestion & Queuing
Implement a background ingestion system for large documents.

Allow users to upload PDFs without blocking the main thread.

🗃️ 2. Message Queue Integration
Use Redis or RabbitMQ to manage ingestion and retrieval requests.

Prevent long-running processes from blocking the application.

Support multiple concurrent users smoothly.

⚙️ 3. Enhanced Architecture
Introduce an asynchronous pipeline for vectorization and retrieval.

Enable scalable deployment through containerization or microservices.

Vector Store	FAISS
Backend	Python
Task Queue (Future)	Redis / RabbitMQ
